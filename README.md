# Two Stage Open Workflow

Server and client code for running wearable cognitive assistance applications
created using Open Workflow Editor, that use the two stage processor.

Object detection is performed using the TensorFlow Object Detection API.
Fine-grained image classification is performed using
[Fast MPN-COV](https://github.com/akindofyoga/fast-MPN-COV).

## Creating Application

1. Create an application using the web tool at
   https://cmusatyalab.github.io/OpenWorkflow/
2. Every processor that you add must be of type "TwoStageProcessor." You can
   import the file `stirling.pbfsm`, from this repository, into the web tool to
   see an example.
3. This code will be run in a Docker container. All classifiers and detectors
   should be accessed using a volume map. The `classifier_path` that you specify
   for each processor must contain the files `model_best.pth.tar` and
   `classes.txt` that resulted from training the Fast MPN-COV model.
4. The `detector_path` must contain `saved_model.pb` and `variables` that result
   from running
   ```
   python object_detection/exporter_main_v2.py --input_type image_tensor \
   --pipeline_config_path <PATH TO pipeline.config> --trained_checkpoint_dir \
   <Path to model_dir> --output_directory <Where to save model>
   ```
   It should also contain a `label_map.pbtxt` file (such as the one created by
   [this](https://github.com/cmusatyalab/tfrecord-scripts/blob/master/merge_tfrecords.py)
   script.
5. `detector_class_name` is the name of the class from the object detector that
   should be classified.
6. `conf_threshold` is the minimum confidence score we require from the object
   detector. Any bounding boxes with a lower confidence score will be ignored.

## Setting up Zoom

1. Create an account on https://developers.zoom.us/. Using a CMU SSO account
   will not work.
2. Create JWT and SDK credentials on https://marketplace.zoom.us/develop/create
3. Download the Android SDK. I have tested this code with v5.7.6.1922. However,
   I suspect newer versions would also work.
4. Navigate to `/zoom-sdk-android-5.7.6.1922/mobilertc-android-studio/` in the
   SDK zip file. Copy the `commonlib` and `mobilertc` directories from here to
   the `android-client` directory of this repository.
5. Go to https://zoom.us/meeting/schedule. On the "Meeting ID" line, select the
   radio button that starts with "Personal Meeting ID," uncheck "Waiting Room,"
   and set the Participant Video option to "on." Then click "Save."
6. On the page that appears, you should see an "Invite Link" URL that ends in
   `web.zoom.us/j/<MEETING_ID>?pwd=<MEETING_PASSWORD>`. Note the meeting ID and
   meeting password.
5. Create a file called `credentials.py` in the `server` directory of this
   repository. Format it as follows, with the proper values. For example,
   replace "SDK key" with your actual SDK key:
```
WEB_KEY = 'JWT API Key'
WEB_SECRET = 'JWT API Secret'

ANDROID_KEY = 'SDK Key'
ANDROID_SECRET = 'SDK Secret'

MEETING_NUMBER = 'MEETING_ID'
MEETING_PASSWORD = 'MEETING_PASSWORD'
```

## Installation

1. Set up an SSL certificate for your server using https://letsencrypt.org/
2. Run the following commands to make copies of the credentials that are
   accessible to Docker:
```
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_HOSTNAME/privkey.pem /path/to/this/repository/server/keys
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_HOSTNAME/fullchain.pem /path/to/this/repository/server/keys
sudo chown $USER /path/to/this/repository/server/keys/privkey.pem
sudo chown $USER /path/to/this/repository/server/keys/fullchain.pem
```
3. Install the Docker container for TensorFlow object detection by following
   [these](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2.md#docker-installation)
   instructions.
4. Run `pip install gabriel-server` from inside the container.
5. Commit the container.
4. Run the container with the command `docker run --gpus all --rm -it -v /path/to/this/repository:/TwoStageOWF -p 9099:9099 -p 8443:8443 YOUR_TAG`
   Note that you object detectors and classifiers must be accessible in the
   directories that you specified in the web editor. You can volume map
   additional directories when starting the container.
5. Run `cd /path/to/this/repository/server` and then
   `python3 server.py /path/to/your/app.pbfsm`
6. Load the interface for the human expert in a browser by navigating to
   https://YOUR_HOSTNAME:8443/. Note that the page will not load if you do not
   include https at the start of the url.

## Client

1. Add the line `gabrielHost="THE_SERVER_HOST"` to
   `android-client/local.properties`
2. Run the client with Android Studio

## Protobuf

`server/wca_state_machine_pb2.py` was copied from
 https://github.com/cmusatyalab/OpenWorkflow/blob/master/gabrieltool/statemachine/wca_state_machine_pb2.py

 `server/owf_pb2.py` gets generated when the Android client is run.
